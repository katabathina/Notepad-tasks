What is .htaccess?

.htaccess is a configuration file for the Apache web server. Itâ€™s an extremely powerful tool, 
that can be used to modify the Apache configuration without needing to edit the Apache configuration files. 
The following sections describe how to create this configuration and use it to restrict directory listings and IP addresses, and to handle redirects.

======================
What is directory indexing?

Directory indexing allows visitors to view a list of files instead of the actual webpage.
When directory indexing is enabled, visitors can look inside any directory that does not have an index.html (or index.php, etc.) 
file in it and browse the contents of the directory.

=================================
Turning off directory indexes?

Place the following line in an .htaccess file in your domain's folder to disable directory indexes throughout your entire site:

Options -Indexes

Now, if someone tries to browse the contents of any directory of your site, they'll get a 403 (Forbidden) error.

======================================================
Turning on directory indexes for specific folders?

If there's a particular directory in your site that you do want people to be able to browse, 
simply create a new .htaccess file in that particular folder. Add the following:

Options +Indexes

This overrides the "global" setting and allows users to view the content of that directory.

=========================
Alternative index files?

When a visitor accesses your website, the server checks the folder for an index file. Some examples of common index files are:


index.htm
index.html
index.php
index.cgi
index.pl

The supported index files depend on how the server is set up. DreamHost's servers are set to:

DirectoryIndex index.html index.shtml index.htm Index.html Index.htm Index.shtml default.htm Default.htm default.html Default.html default.shtml 
Default.shtml page1.html index.pl index.cgi index.php index.php3 index.phtml home.htm home.html home.shtml index.wml index.pcgi quickstart.html

===================================
Where to put your .htaccess file?

Generally, you put the .htaccess file in your website's main directory. 
However, the location ultimately depends on what you're attempting to do with the .htaccess file
The .htaccess file can control behavior for every directory under the folder it resides in. 
For this reason it can also be in your user's home directory. Again, it depends on what you're using the .htaccess file for.
