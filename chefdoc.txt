==================================
https://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/create-a-simple-chef-cookbooks-to-manage-your-centos-rhel-infrastructure.html



In this portion, we will create a simple cookbook to install and configure an Apache web server.

1 .Log into your Chef workstation, go to your ~/chef-repo/cookbooks directory.
 
  cd ~/chef-repo/cookbooks/

2. Create the cookbook called “httpd“. Replace “httpd“, if you want to name it differently.

    chef generate cookbook httpd

3. Go to your newly created cookbook’s directory, i.e., httpd
   
   cd httpd
   
   output come like below:-
   
     rw-r--r--. 1 root root   47 Nov 12 21:18 Berksfile
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 1133 Nov 12 21:18 chefignore
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  568 Nov 12 21:18 metadata.rb
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root   53 Nov 12 21:18 README.md
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root   23 Nov 12 21:18 recipes
drwxr-xr-x. 3 root root   38 Nov 12 21:18 spec
drwxr-xr-x. 3 root root   20 Nov 12 21:18 test

4.  Go to the recipes directory. There you can see a file called “default.rb“. 
     We are going to use this file to add resources for that are required for getting the Apache server running.
	 
     cd recipes
     cat default.rb
	 
5. Install Apache:

To begin, let’s add a resource for installing apache package.

   package 'httpd' do
      action :install
   end
   
6. Next, make the Apache service to start automatically at the system startup and also the service should be up and running. 
   Below code does what we required.
   
   service 'httpd' do
      action [ :enable, :start ]
   end
   
7. Index File:

 Our next resource is for placing the index.html file on the document root of Apache server.
 All you need to specify the location where want the file and from where to get the file.
 
    cookbook_file "/var/www/html/index.html" do

	source "index.html"
       mode "0644"
    end

8. Creating the Index File:
	
Since we have defined a “cookbook_file” resource, we need to create 
a source file “index.html” inside files subdirectory of your cookbook.

   cd ~/chef-repo/cookbooks
   
9. Create a subdirectory “files” under your cookbook.
    
    mkdir httpd/files

10. Add a simple text into the index.html.

     echo "Installed and Setup Using Chef" > httpd/files/index.html

11.  Firewall:

Our last resource will be for configuring the firewall to allow http and https traffic from external machines.

       execute 'httpd_firewall' do
         command '/usr/bin/firewall-cmd  --permanent --zone public --add-service http'
         ignore_failure true
       end

       execute 'reload_firewall' do
         command '/usr/bin/firewall-cmd --reload'
         ignore_failure true
       end	

12.  The final version of default.rb will look like below.
 
      vi ~chef-repo/cookbooks/httpd/recpies/default.rb




#
# Cookbook Name:: httpd
# Recipe:: default
#
# Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors, All Rights Reserved.

package 'httpd' do
  action :install
end

service 'httpd' do
  action [ :enable, :start ]
end

cookbook_file "/var/www/html/index.html" do
  source "index.html"
  mode "0644"
end

execute 'httpd_firewall' do
  command '/usr/bin/firewall-cmd  --permanent --zone public --add-service http'
  ignore_failure true
end

execute 'reload_firewall' do
  command '/usr/bin/firewall-cmd --reload'
  ignore_failure true
end



==========================


Upload the cookbook:-

1. Once your cookbook is complete, you can upload them on to your Chef server.
    
	knife cookbook upload httpd

2. Check whether you can list the cookbook that you just have been uploaded.

   knife cookbook list

3. To remove the cookbook (optional).

   knife cookbook delete cookbook_name

 ====================================
 
 Add the Cookbook to your node:
 
1 .You can add a cookbook to the run_list of a particular node using the following command.
   Replace chefclient.itzgeek.local with your client node name.
   
      knife node run_list add chefclient.itzgeek.local httpd
	  
	  
Output:-

    chefclient.itzgeek.local:
      run_list: recipe[httpd]

2. To remove the particular recipe from run_list (optional).

     knife node run_list remove chefclient.itzgeek.local recipe[cookbook_name]
